# Innomatics_Data_Analysis-EV-Hackathon

Data is of high-value in todayâ€™s rapidly growing environment. I am always interested in learning about new technologies in this ever-changing field of computing.
Over the weekend I participated in a Hackathon conducted by Innomatics Research labs. 
Through this hackathon, I could leverage my learnings, which gave me an opportunity to explore the practical applications of Data Analysis field. 

The Project idea was to do Data Analysis on Electric vehicles.
*Task1 was to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate and Bivariate) using plotly.express library.
  *Insights: 
    - 
*Task2 was to create a Choropleth to display the number of EV vehicles based on location.
  *Insights: 
    - 
*Task3 was to create a Racing Bar Plot to display the animation of EV Make and its count each year.
  *Insights: 
    - 
It has been an enriching experience being able to take part in such wonderfully planned event that has helped me sharpen my knowledge.
The Analysis was done with the help of Python and I used various modules such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
I was fascinated by the fact that we can transform data into critical fragments of information and get insights to make informed meaningful decisions. 

Thank you IRL for organizing the hackathon and everyone who made this hackathon possible,
